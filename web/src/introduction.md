# Minimizing Trust, Maximizing Truth

*The Architecture of Verifiable Secrets*

**by particle**

---

This book teaches you how to build zero-knowledge proofs from the ground up.

Zero-knowledge proofs represent one of the most remarkable achievements in cryptography: the ability to prove that a statement is true without revealing anything beyond its truth. They enable a world where verification replaces trust, where privacy and transparency coexist, and where mathematical certainty can be achieved without exposing the underlying data.

## What You'll Learn

This book takes you from foundational concepts to cutting-edge constructions:

- **Foundations**: The trust problem, polynomial magic, and the sum-check protocol
- **Core Protocols**: GKR, polynomial commitments, and hash-based constructions
- **SNARK Systems**: Groth16, PLONK, and STARKs explained in depth
- **Zero-Knowledge**: How to add privacy to proof systems
- **Advanced Topics**: Recursion, composition, and practical considerations

## Prerequisites

This book assumes familiarity with:
- Finite field algebra
- Elliptic curve cryptography
- Basic concepts of cryptography

*Let's begin by understanding why we need zero-knowledge proofs in the first place.*
